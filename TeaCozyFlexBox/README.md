<h2>Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy Project</h2>
  <p>In this project, I will create a fictional tea shop website on my own computer.

Codecademy will provide a design spec and image assets to help me along the way. A design spec is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. 
These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer.</p> 
 <p>This project assumes that I will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.</p>
