<h1>Challenge: Build Your Own Cheatsheet</h1>

<p>
This project is slightly different than others I have encountered thus far on Codecademy.
  Instead of a tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project I will be building. 
  There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and I am expected to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when I encounter a problem.
</p>

<h3>Project Goals</h3>
<p>
My project should document at least one HTML or CSS topic. 
In Codecademy example project, I documented the tags and attributes used in HTML tables layouts, but Ican choose any HTML or CSS topic that Iâ€™ve learned so far.


<h3>Possible topics could be:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>HTML Tables</li>
  <li>Other HTML tags</li>
  <li>CSS selectors and specificity</li>
  <li>Common CSS properties</li>
</ol>
</p>
