<h1>CSS Grid Task Board page from CodeCademy.</h1>

<p> In this project, I will create a board of to-do items organized into columns. All of the HTML and most of the CSS have been written for me, but the grid property declarations have yet to be added.</p>

<p>In order to complete this project, I must know how to lay out the structure of a gridâ€™s rows and columns and place items within that grid using CSS.
