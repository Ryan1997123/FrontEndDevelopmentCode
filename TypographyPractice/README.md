<h1>Tide Blade Novel Website: Typography Practice</h1>
<p>
Aoife Conleavy is a novelist who has been writing about her travels for nearly two decades. Before the launch of her new novel Tide Blade, which features the stories of real-life characters in Morocco, the author wants to spruce up her professional website. <br>
<br>I will modify the typography on her site, changing the size, style, and font families, to make the page easier to read.

Using my understanding of typography, I am tasked to help Aoife Conleavy improve the readability of her site for her readers.
