<h1>Practing CSS Grids with the PupSpa page from CodeCademy.</h1>

<p>
Let’s practice what we’ve just learned about CSS Grid through building a classic, grid-based, responsive web page. Your friend has just opened a doggie daycare and grooming services shop, PupSpa. They would like a simple web page to let customers know about their services.

  We currently have an HTML document styled with CSS, but every <b>div</b> appears in its own row. Let’s add some CSS grid properties to make parts of the site appear more cohesive. Some of the properties we’ll by using include:

display<br>
grid-template-rows<br>
grid-template-columns<br>
grid-gap<br>
grid-column-start<br>
grid-column-end<br>
<br>We’ll also cover a couple of the shorthand properties of these as well, so let’s get started!<br>
