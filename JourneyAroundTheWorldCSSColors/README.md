  <h1>Journey Around the World - Practicing Color Theory  </h1>
  
 <p>In this project, I will use the knowledge I gained on color theory and apply it to a simple web page. 
   I will take an existing grayscale website, select a color scheme, and apply the colors to various elements and sections within the design.</p>

 <p>This means I will need to consider how to select my color scheme, adhere to proper contrast of elements, 
   and carefully apply those colors to the page to create an elegant design.</p>

<p>*Important* must use the color wheel tool to determine my color scheme and properly pair colors together. 
  When applying colors to the page, make sure you select a dominant color with additional supporting colors that provide structure to the design.</p>

  <p>When changing the colors within my code, I will use either hexadecimal, RGB, or HSL values.</p>
