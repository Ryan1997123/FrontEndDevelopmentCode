<h1> Build a Website Design System </h1>

<p>This project is slightly different than the others I have encountered thus far on Codecademy.<p>
<p>Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project I will be building. (see html file for steps)</p>
<p>There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and I am expected to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when I encounter a problem .</p>
