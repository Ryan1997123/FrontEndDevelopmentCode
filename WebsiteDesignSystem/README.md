<h1> Build a Website Design System </h1>

<p>This project is slightly different than the others I have encountered thus far on Codecademy.<p>
<p>Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project I will be building. (see html file for steps)</p>
<p>There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and I am expected to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when necessary.</p>

<h3>Project Goals:</h3>
<p>In this project, I will be building your own basic design system for a website. In essence, I will be building a website to help you build MORE websites in the future! On my own site, I will collect all the colors, fonts, and some of the repeating styles.</p>
