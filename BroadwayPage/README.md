  <h1>Broadway Project</h1> 
  <p>In this project, I will use properties such as display and position to improve the layout of the landing page for a fictional design firm, Broadway Design.</p>
  <p>The site has some style rules to begin with. I will improve the layout and positioning of the navigation menu at the top of the page and the three supporting sections (Design, Develop, Deploy) below the image.</p>
