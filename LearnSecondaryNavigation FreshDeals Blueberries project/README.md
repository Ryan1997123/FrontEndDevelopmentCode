  <h1>FreshDeals: Blueberries  </h1>

  <h3>This project is from Codecademy's "Learn Secondary Navigation" second in the Front-End Engineering Course.</h3>
  
 <p>In the browser to the right, there is a site for buying groceries. The currently selected product is “Organic Blueberries”. If you landed on this page, one may have some questions.</p>

<p>Can I buy anything besides blueberries?</p>

<p>Is everything on this site organic or can I buy conventional produce?</p>

</p>Does this site offer non-produce items?</p>

<p>By adding breadcrumbs to this site, I will be adding a UI element that hints to some of the questions above. By doing so, users will have a better feeling for what the site provides and the optional attributes of the product they are purchasing.</p>

</p> For this project with Codecademy, I am focused on the layout of this page and will be implementing the breadcrumbs via HTML and CSS. The links to the breadcrumbs will not function.</p>
