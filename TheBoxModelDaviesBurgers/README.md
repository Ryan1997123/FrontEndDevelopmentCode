<h1>Davie's Burgers (learning the box model)</h1>

<body>
  <p>In this project, I will follow step-by-step instructions to fix a fictional restaurant’s website. 
   <br> All of the HTML and most of the CSS is intact, but the box model properties have yet to be set. 
    <br> I’ll use my knowledge of height, width, padding, border, and margin to complete this project.</p>
